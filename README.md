# 🌌 Solar System Simulation

A dynamic 3D simulation of the solar system built using **Python**, **Pygame**, and **PyOpenGL**.  
This project features realistic orbiting planets, rotating axes, background starfield motion, camera controls, and Saturn's iconic ring — all in a beautifully rendered scene with relaxing background music.

## 🪐 Features

- Real-time orbiting and spinning of 8 planets
- 3D starfield animation
- Saturn's rings implemented with OpenGL quad strips
- Camera control (rotation and zoom)
- Basic shading to simulate lighting effects
- Meditative background music loop
